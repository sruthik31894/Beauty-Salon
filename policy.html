        <div class="textcenter">Look, we love your puppers... but its a people salon so you'll have to leave your four legged friend at home when you visit us. 
        While we wish we didn't have to discriminate against the better species, it is against health standards to have them in our treatment rooms and areas where services are being held. We also have to respect our clients who may not be as comfortable around animals as we are, 
        If you bring your pup to your service, you will have to leave them outside or take them home before you can have services completed. If this results in you having to miss or cancel your appointment, policy fees will be applied.<br>
        * Service animals are an exception, however please let us know in advance as we will have to arrange a time you can have your appointment in a private room or when there are no other clients in the salon.<br>
        *This restriction also applies to cate, birds and any other animals..</div><br>
